## ⏳ NEED FROM ROSS (5 MINUTES)

### 1. Reddit Karma Check (2 min)
Go to: https://www.reddit.com/user/rnc5096

Tell me:

- **Comment Karma:** ___

*(Some subreddits require minimum karma to post)*

### 2. Review Launch Content (3 min)
Read: `~/clawd/fitness-tracker/LAUNCH_CONTENT.md`

Does the launch tweet sound like you? If anything feels off-brand, tell me and I'll rewrite.

**Current launch tweet:**
> Spent the last week building a calorie tracker that doesn't make me want to throw my phone.
> 
> Voice logging: Hold button → speak → done
> Photo logging: Snap → AI analyzes → confirm
> 
> Free while I figure out what people actually want.
> 
> [LINK]

Good to go? Or want it more aggressive/casual/technical?

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: READ THIS

**Tomorrow at 9 AM, I will send you a Telegram message with your launch tweet.**

**Your job: Post it within 5 minutes.**

No overthinking. No editing. No "let me think about it."

Just copy → paste → post.

**The game is execution speed. Not perfection.**

---

## WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY TESTING

Not "will this app make millions?"

Testing:
1. **Does anyone care?** (signups)
2. **Does it actually work?** (daily logging rate)
3. **What do real users want?** (feedback)

**Launch = learning phase. Not revenue phase.**

---

## NEXT STEPS (RIGHT NOW)

1. Reply to Jarvis with Reddit karma scores
2. Approve launch tweet (or request edits)
3. Get some sleep

Tomorrow we execute.
