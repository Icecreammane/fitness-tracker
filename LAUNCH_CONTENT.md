# Lean App - Launch Content

## LAUNCH TWEET (Post Feb 15, 9:00 AM)
**Post from @_icecreammane**

Spent the last week building a calorie tracker that doesn't make me want to throw my phone.

Voice logging: Hold button → speak → done
Photo logging: Snap → AI analyzes → confirm

Free while I figure out what people actually want.

## FOLLOW-UP TWEETS (Throughout Day 1)

**Tweet 2 (11:00 AM):**
The problem with every fitness app: they make tracking feel like homework.

Lean's entire philosophy: speed = dopamine, friction = failure.

If logging a meal takes >10 seconds, you won't do it tomorrow.

**Tweet 3 (2:00 PM):**
Built this because I was tired of typing "grilled chicken breast, 6oz, steamed broccoli" into MyFitnessPal for the 1000th time.

Now I just say it out loud. Whisper AI transcribes, GPT-4o estimates macros. 3 seconds total.

**Tweet 4 (5:00 PM):**
Day 1 feedback has been wild. People want:
- Meal photo predictions
- AI that learns your eating patterns
- One-tap meal prep generator

Shipping these next week. This is what building in public feels like.

**Tweet 5 (8:00 PM):**
30 people signed up today. 12 already logged meals.

The metric that matters: will they come back tomorrow?

That's the only way to know if this actually works.

## REDDIT POST #1: r/SideProject

**Title:** Built a calorie tracker that uses AI to log meals in 3 seconds [Free, Open Beta]

**Post:**

I hate calorie tracking. It's tedious, slow, and feels like busywork.

So I spent the last week building something faster: **Lean**

**How it works:**
- Hold button → speak your meal → AI logs it (3 seconds)
- Or snap a photo → AI analyzes → tap to confirm (5 seconds)
- Dashboard shows your progress, streak, and goal projection

**Why I built it:**
Every fitness app feels like homework. MyFitnessPal makes you type everything manually. Lose It is cluttered. I wanted something that prioritizes speed over features.

**What's working:**
- Voice logging with Whisper AI (accurate transcription)
- GPT-4o macro estimation (surprisingly good)
- Streak tracking (dopamine hit)

**What I'm testing:**
- AI meal predictions (learns your patterns)
- One-tap meal prep generator
- Progress photo comparisons

**Tech stack:** Flask, OpenAI API, vanilla JS, Chart.js

**Status:** Free during beta. Looking for brutally honest feedback.

Open to questions about the build, AI integration, or product decisions.

## REDDIT POST #2: r/InternetIsBeautiful

**Title:** This web app logs your meals via voice in ~3 seconds

**Post:**

Link: [URL]

I built this because I was tired of manually typing meals into MyFitnessPal.

**What it does:**
Hold a button, speak your meal (e.g., "turkey sandwich and protein shake"), AI transcribes + estimates macros, done.

Or snap a photo of your food and it analyzes it with GPT-4o Vision.

**Why it's interesting:**
Most calorie trackers optimize for accuracy (databases, barcode scanning, manual entry). This one optimizes for speed. The theory: if tracking takes <10 seconds, you'll actually do it daily.

Built with Flask + OpenAI Whisper + GPT-4o. Free during beta.

Happy to answer questions about how the AI works or what went into building it.

## REDDIT POST #3: r/Fitness (Saturday, Nutrition Thread)

**Title:** [Progress] Built an AI calorie tracker to stay consistent - 14 days in

**Post:**

**Stats:** 30M, 6'1", SW: 225 lbs, CW: 222 lbs, GW: 200 lbs

**Problem:** I've tried calorie tracking 10+ times. Always quit within 2 weeks because logging meals manually is annoying.

**Solution:** Built an app that uses voice logging. Hold button → speak meal → AI estimates macros. Takes 3 seconds.

**Why it works for me:**
- Zero friction = actually do it daily
- Streak counter = dopamine motivation
- Visual progress tracker = see the trend

**Tech:** OpenAI Whisper (speech-to-text) + GPT-4o (macro estimation). Surprisingly accurate for estimating portions.

**14-day results:**
- Logged every single meal (first time ever)
- 3 lb loss (on track for goal)
- Deficit averaging 500 cal/day

Making it free while I test it: [URL]

Not trying to sell anything—genuinely curious if this approach works for others or if I'm just weird.

## DM TEMPLATE (Send to 10 Friends)

Hey man, quick favor—

Built a fitness app this week and need brutally honest feedback. Takes 30 seconds to try.

Voice logging: hold button, say your meal, done. Or snap a photo.

Would mean a lot if you could test it and tell me what sucks: [URL]

No pressure if you're not into fitness stuff. Just need real user feedback before I launch it publicly.
