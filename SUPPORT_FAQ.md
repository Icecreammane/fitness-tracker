## 💳 Billing & Payments

### "How do I cancel my subscription?"

```
Hi [Name],

To cancel your subscription:

1. Go to your Stripe customer portal: [Link to portal]
2. Click "Cancel subscription"
3. Confirm cancellation

Your subscription will remain active until the end of your current billing period. After that, you won't be charged again.

Your data stays safe even after canceling. You can reactivate anytime!

Let me know if you need help.

Best,
Ross

### "Can I get a refund?"

**If within 30 days:**
```
Hi [Name],

Yes! We offer refunds within 30 days of your first payment.

I've processed a full refund for you. It should appear in your account within 5-7 business days.

Sorry FitTrack Pro wasn't the right fit. If you want to share why you're leaving, I'd love to hear your feedback to make the app better.

Best,
Ross
```

**If after 30 days:**
```
Hi [Name],

Unfortunately, our refund policy only covers the first 30 days after your initial payment.

However, I can cancel your subscription immediately so you won't be charged again. Would you like me to do that?

If you're having issues with the app, I'd love to help troubleshoot instead. What's not working for you?

Best,
Ross
```

---

### "My payment failed. What should I do?"

```
Hi [Name],

Your payment failed, but don't worry - this happens!

Common reasons:
- Expired card
- Insufficient funds
- Bank declined the charge

**To update your payment method:**
[Update Payment Link]

Your subscription is still active for the next 3 days while we retry. Update your card to avoid losing access.

Need help? Just reply!

Best,
Ross

### "Can I get a discount?"

**For students/unemployed:**
```
Hi [Name],

Thanks for reaching out! I don't have an official student discount yet, but I want to help.

I can offer you 50% off for 3 months ($4.99/month instead of $9.99). Does that work?

If so, use this link: [Special discount link]

Best,
Ross
```

**For annual plan request:**
```
Hi [Name],

Great question! I don't have an annual plan yet, but I'm working on it.

Would you be interested in $99/year (save ~17%)? If I get a few more requests like yours, I'll build it!

For now, monthly is the only option, but I appreciate the feedback.

Best,
Ross

## 🔐 Account & Login

### "I forgot my password. How do I reset it?"

**Current (manual process):**
```
Hi [Name],

I can help you reset your password.

To verify your identity, can you tell me:
1. The email you signed up with
2. Approximate date you created your account

Once verified, I'll send you a temporary password.

(Note: We're building an automated password reset feature soon!)

Best,
Ross
```

---

### "I can't log in. It says 'Invalid email or password.'"

```
Hi [Name],

Let's troubleshoot:

1. **Check your email** - Make sure there are no typos or extra spaces
2. **Try resetting your password** - Reply to this email and I'll help
3. **Check if you signed up** - Did you complete the signup process?

If none of that works, reply with the email you used and I'll look into it.

Best,
Ross
```

---

### "Can I change my email address?"

```
Hi [Name],

Yes! I can update your email manually.

What's your current email: ___________
What's your new email: ___________

I'll make the change within 24 hours and confirm once done.

(Note: Automated email changes coming soon!)

Best,
Ross

1. Go to your dashboard
2. Scroll to "Log Food"
3. Enter:
   - Description (e.g., "Chicken breast, rice, broccoli")
   - Calories
   - Protein (g)
   - Carbs (g)
   - Fat (g)
4. Click "Log Food"

Your daily totals will update automatically and show in the charts!

Pro tip: Log as you eat (morning, afternoon, evening) for best accuracy.

Let me know if you need help!

Best,
Ross
```

### "How do I track my workouts?"

```
Hi [Name],

To log a workout:

1. Dashboard → "Log Workout"
2. For each lift, enter:
   - Exercise name (e.g., "Bench Press")
   - Weight (lbs)
   - Reps
3. Click "Add Lift" for multiple exercises
4. Click "Save Workout"

The app will automatically calculate your estimated 1RM (one-rep max) for each lift!

Your strength progress will show in the charts over time.

Happy lifting! 💪

### "How do I set my macro goals?"

```
Hi [Name],

To set your daily macro goals:

1. Dashboard → Settings (gear icon)
2. Enter:
   - Target weight
   - Daily calories
   - Daily protein (g)
   - Daily carbs (g)
   - Daily fat (g)
3. Save

Your dashboard will now show progress bars for each macro based on your goals!

Not sure what your macros should be? I recommend:

- Carbs: Fill the rest of your calories

Best,
Ross

### "Can I export my data?"

**Current (manual):**
```
Hi [Name],

Yes! I can export your data for you.

Reply with confirmation and I'll send you a JSON file with:
- All your workouts
- All your food logs
- All your weight entries

You can then import it into a spreadsheet or another app.

(Note: Automated export feature coming soon!)

Best,
Ross
```

---

### "Do you have a mobile app?"

```
Hi [Name],

Not yet! FitTrack Pro is currently web-based (works on mobile browsers).

A native mobile app (iOS/Android) is on the roadmap for Q2 2026.

For now, you can:
- Use your phone's browser
- Add FitTrack Pro to your home screen (acts like an app)

Would you prefer iOS or Android? Let me know so I can prioritize!

Best,
Ross
```

## 🐛 Technical Issues

### "The app won't load / I see a blank screen"

```
Hi [Name],

Sorry you're having trouble! Let's fix this:

**Try these steps:**
1. **Hard refresh** - Hold Shift and click Reload (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
2. **Clear cache** - Browser settings → Clear browsing data
3. **Try a different browser** - Chrome works best
4. **Check internet connection** - Make sure you're online

If none of that works, reply with:
- What browser you're using (Chrome, Safari, Firefox?)
- What device (Mac, PC, phone?)
- Any error messages you see

I'll investigate and get you back up and running!

Best,
Ross
```

---

### "My data isn't saving"

```
Hi [Name],

That's frustrating! Let's troubleshoot:

1. **Check your internet connection** - Data saves to the cloud
2. **Try logging out and back in** - Sometimes this resets the connection
3. **Clear your browser cache** - Old cache can cause issues

If the problem persists, reply with:
- What action you're trying (log food, workout, etc.)
- When it started happening
- Any error messages

I'll look into it immediately!

Best,
Ross
```

---

### "The charts aren't showing my data"

```
Hi [Name],

Charts only show data from the last 7 days.

**Common reasons for blank charts:**
- You haven't logged anything in the past week
- Data was logged more than 7 days ago

**To fix:**
- Log a few meals or workouts today
- Refresh the page
- Charts should populate!

If you've logged recently and still see blank charts, let me know and I'll investigate.

Best,
Ross
```

## 📱 Feature Requests

### "Can you add [Feature X]?"

```
Hi [Name],

Thanks for the suggestion! I love hearing what users want.

[Feature X] is [on the roadmap / interesting idea / something I'll consider].

I'm tracking feature requests in a list. Yours is #[X] in the queue!

Priority is based on:
- How many users request it
- How long it takes to build
- How much value it adds

Keep the feedback coming - it shapes the product!

Best,
Ross
```

---

### "Do you have an API?"

```
Hi [Name],

Not yet! An API is on the roadmap for later this year.

What would you use it for? I'd love to hear your use case.

If I get enough requests, I'll prioritize it.

Best,
Ross
```

## 🆘 Emergency Support

### "I was charged twice!"

```
Hi [Name],

Sorry about that! Let me look into it.

Can you forward me the Stripe receipt email(s) showing the duplicate charges?

I'll investigate immediately and refund any incorrect charges within 24 hours.

Best,
Ross
```

---

### "Someone else is accessing my account!"

```
Hi [Name],

That's concerning! Let's secure your account immediately.

**I've:**
1. Reset your password (check your email for new password)
2. Logged out all sessions
3. Checked recent activity (no suspicious logins detected)

**Next steps:**
1. Change your password again (use a strong one)
2. Enable 2FA when we launch it (coming soon)
3. Don't share your login with anyone

If you see anything suspicious, reply immediately.

Best,
Ross

## 💬 General Inquiries

### "Who built FitTrack Pro?"

```
Hi [Name],

I'm Ross, the founder and sole developer (for now!).

I built FitTrack Pro because I was frustrated with existing fitness apps - either too complicated or too basic.

FitTrack Pro is my side project turned SaaS. I'm a solo founder, so you're talking directly to the person who codes, designs, and supports the app!

Thanks for being a user. Your feedback shapes the product!

Best,
Ross
```

3. **Bug reports** - Describe what's broken

I read every message and reply personally.

Thanks for helping make FitTrack Pro better!
