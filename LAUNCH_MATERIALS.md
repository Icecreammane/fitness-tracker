# Launch Materials - FitTrack Pro

## Reddit Post - r/fitness

**Title:** I built a dead-simple fitness tracker for people who actually lift ($10/mo, 7-day free trial)

**Body:**

Hey r/fitness,

I got tired of overcomplicated fitness apps that try to do everything. I just wanted to track my macros, log my lifts, and see my progress. So I built FitTrack Pro.

**What it does:**
- Track daily macros (protein, carbs, fat, calories)
- Log workouts with automatic 1RM calculator
- Weight progress charts
- 7-day macro history
- Clean, fast interface

**What it doesn't do:**
- Social features
- Meal planning
- Recipe databases
- Complicated workout programs
- Try to sell you supplements

It's $10/month with a 7-day free trial (no credit card required).

I built this for myself and have been using it daily for the past month. Figured others might find it useful too.

**Tweet 1:**
I built a fitness tracker for people who don't want BS features they'll never use.

Just macros, workouts, and progress tracking. $10/mo.

7-day free trial, no credit card required.

🧵 Here's why I built it:

**Tweet 2:**
Every fitness app tries to be everything:
• Social network ✗
• Meal planner ✗
• Recipe database ✗
• Community forums ✗

I just wanted to track my protein and log my lifts. 

So I built exactly that. Nothing more.

**Tweet 3:**
Features:
✓ Daily macro tracking (protein, carbs, fat, cals)
✓ Workout logging + 1RM calculator
✓ Weight trend charts
✓ 7-day history
✓ Works on all devices

That's it. That's the whole app.

**Tweet 4:**
No complicated onboarding.
No tutorials.
No "discover" feed.

Sign up → Start tracking → See results.

Takes 30 seconds to log a meal. Takes 1 minute to log a workout.

Speed over features.

**Tweet 5:**
Pricing is simple too:
• 7-day free trial (no CC required)
• $10/month after
• Cancel anytime

No "premium" tiers. No upsells. Everyone gets everything.

**Tweet 6:**
Built it in Flask, deployed on Railway.

Stripe for payments. Chart.js for graphs. 

Took 6 hours from idea to live product.
