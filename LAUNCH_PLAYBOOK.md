## What I Need From You Right Now

1. ✅ Reddit username: rnc5096 (got it)
2. ⏳ Progress photo (take tonight)
3. ⏳ Reddit karma check (tell me your post + comment karma)
4. ⏳ Twitter/X handle (so I can tag you in drafts)

Once I have those 3 things, I'll finalize everything and you'll just copy-paste tomorrow.

## Backup Plan (If Something Breaks)

**App crashes:**
- I fix it within 30 min
- You tweet: "Site traffic crashed the server. Scaling up. Back in 30 min."

**Reddit removes post:**
- I rewrite to fit rules
- You repost in different subreddit

**No signups:**
- I analyze landing page
- Adjust copy/CTA
- Run quick Facebook test ad ($50)

**All handled. You just tell me what happened.**

---

## Success Metrics (Day 1)

- 🎯 50+ page visits
- 🎯 10+ signups
- 🎯 3+ people log meals
- 🎯 1+ piece of useful feedback

If we hit those, we have proof of concept.

## Questions?

Tell me:
- Reddit karma scores
- Twitter handle  
- When you take progress photo

Then I'll lock in the plan and we execute tomorrow.
