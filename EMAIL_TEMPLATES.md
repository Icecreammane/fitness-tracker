## 📅 Trial Onboarding Sequence

### Day 1: Welcome Email

**Subject**: Welcome to FitTrack Pro! Here's what to do first 🚀

**From**: Ross <ross@fittrackpro.com>

**Body**:
```
Hi [Name],

Welcome to FitTrack Pro! I'm Ross, the founder. Thanks for signing up.

You have 7 days to try the app completely free. No credit card required (yet).

**Your first steps:**

1. **Set your goals** - Go to Settings and enter your target weight and daily macros
2. **Log your first meal** - Track what you eat today (protein, carbs, fat)
3. **Log a workout** - Add your lifts and watch your strength progress over time

**Pro tip:** The app gets more powerful the more you use it. Consistent logging = better insights.

Need help? Just reply to this email. I read every message.

Let's do this! 💪

### Day 3: Feature Highlight

**Subject**: Here's how to get the most out of FitTrack Pro

**Body**:
```
Hi [Name],

Hope you're enjoying FitTrack Pro so far!

Quick tip: The **Progress Charts** are my favorite feature. They show your weight, calories, and macros over time so you can see exactly what's working.

**To view your charts:**
1. Open the dashboard
2. Scroll down to "Your Progress"
3. See your last 7 days visualized

**Fun fact:** Users who log their meals at least 5 days/week see 3x better results than those who log sporadically. Consistency > perfection.

Keep crushing it!
