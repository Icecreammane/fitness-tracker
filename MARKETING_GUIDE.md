## 🚀 Launch Day Strategy (Day 1)

### 1. Reddit (Highest ROI)

**Subreddits to Post**:
- r/Fitness (3.5M members)
- r/weightroom (650K members)
- r/leangains (250K members)
- r/bodyweightfitness (2M members)
- r/xxfitness (550K, women's fitness)
- r/SaaS (180K, entrepreneurs)
- r/SideProject (200K, indie makers)

**Post Template** (Adjust tone per subreddit):

```
Title: Built a fitness tracker for people who want precision (7-day free trial)

Body:
Hey r/Fitness,

I spent the last 2 weeks building FitTrack Pro - a fitness tracking app for people who are serious about their goals.

**What it does:**
- Track workouts with 1RM estimates
- Log macros (protein, carbs, fat)
- Visualize progress over time (weight, calories, strength)
- Clean, modern interface (no clutter)

**Why I built it:**
Most fitness apps are either too complicated (MyFitnessPal) or too simple (spreadsheets). I wanted something in the middle - precision tracking without the noise.

**Pricing:**
$9.99/month after a 7-day free trial. No credit card required for trial.

**Would love feedback from this community.** What features would you want to see?

```

**Tips**:
- Post during peak hours (9am-11am EST, 6pm-8pm EST)
- Respond to ALL comments within 1 hour
- Be humble, ask for feedback
- Don't spam - post once per subreddit, max

**Expected**: 50-200 visitors per post, 2-10 signups.

## 📊 Tracking Marketing Effectiveness

### Google Analytics Goals

Set up conversions:

3. Paid conversion (Stripe webhook event)

**Check weekly**:
- Which traffic source converts best? (Reddit, Product Hunt, Twitter?)

### Attribution Tracking

Use UTM parameters:

- Twitter: `?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=launch`
